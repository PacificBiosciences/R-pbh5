PacificBiosciences/R
====================

A collection of [R](www.r-project.org) packages for interacting with data from the Pacific Biosciences platform. Currently the package contains two different R packages: pbh5 and pbutils. By far the more interesting/relevant package is the pbh5 R package which provides functionality for accessing data produced from PacBio sequencing machines. This package supports accessing data from:

+ cmp.h5
+ bas.h5
+ trc.h5 

## Dependencies ##

* h5r - [h5r](http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/h5r/)
